                    In an ecosystem defined by entropy and noise, I focus on the signal. I am a Cybersecurity Analyst and with a developer background dedicated to the art of defense. 
                    While the breaker’s mindset is valuable, my loyalty lies with the builders and the protectors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My background spans the full spectrum of system reliability—from the rapid-response trenches of a SOC to the architectural logic of software development and support. 
                    I don’t just patch vulnerabilities; I seek to understand the systemic flaws that allow them to exist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a proponent of the Cypherpunk ethos: privacy is a right, and code is the medium to secure it. 
                    I believe in the power of open source, the necessity of decentralization, and the elegance of strong cryptography. 
                    When I am not hardening systems or analyzing logs, you will likely find me deep in hacker literature, learning from the history of our digital underground to better secure its future.
                </p>
                <ul class="about-list">
                    <li class="list-header"><b>Core Kernels:</b></li>

                    <li>Defense -> Offense: I specialize in SOC analysis and system hardening. I find peace in the shield, not the sword.</li>

                    <li>Open Source Advocate: Believer in transparency, decentralization, and the collaborative power of the community.</li>

                    <li>Continuous Iteration: My knowledge base is always under construction.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I view cybersecurity through the lens of privacy and individual sovereignty. 
                    Whether I am writing code, providing high-level support, or auditing traffic, I apply the principles of the Cypherpunk movement to modern security challenges. 
                    I am a student of the culture—reading the man pages, the manifestos, and the code that powers our world.
